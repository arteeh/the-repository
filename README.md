# The Repository

This repository is used for issue tracking and backups of the Repository, a wiki for Ghostrunner.

You can find the issue board here: https://gitlab.com/arteeh/the-repository/-/boards

It may also be used in the future as an open source repository for the entire website, so multiple people can work on the site's backend simultaneously.
